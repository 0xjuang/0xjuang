I'm an **Automation-Oriented Systems Engineer** working at the intersection of development, infrastructure, and security. My work focuses on infrastructure automation, secure scripting, system design, and hands-on experimentation in a purpose-built lab.  
While I don’t build frontend interfaces, I manage the full lifecycle of backend systems — from provisioning and orchestration to hardening and monitoring — giving me a comprehensive, operational view of real-world infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Homelab Engineering

My self-hosted lab ([GG3-DevNet](https://github.com/gg3-dev)) simulates a scaled-down enterprise environment:

- 🔐 VLAN segmentation, firewalling, and secure routing via pfSense
    
- ☁️ Virtualized infrastructure with XCP-ng and networked storage
    
- 🐍 Python-powered automation: backups, SSH workflows, rsync, snapshot pipelines
    
- 🔧 CI/CD with Jenkins, shell scripts, cron jobs, and Git hooks
    
- 🧰 Custom tools for SSH key security, configuration management, and documentation
    
- 🧪 WireGuard VPN, NGINX reverse proxy, and self-contained service stacks
    

Tools and documentation are open-source:

- [gg3utils](https://github.com/gg3-dev/gg3utils): My modular utility library for SSH, scripting, backups, and automation
    
- [gg3-docs](https://github.com/gg3-dev/gg3-docs): Living documentation of system architecture and workflows
    

> This lab is my personal research ground — a space to test, break, and secure systems like an operator.

## 🔐 DevSecOps & Security Mindset

My approach to development is rooted in operational awareness:

- I secure by default: SSH key best practices, passphrase-based authentication, key rotation
    
- I isolate infrastructure: VLANs, firewall rules, jump hosts, and segmented WireGuard VPNs
    
- I document everything: Markdown-based runbooks, reproducible setups, minimal-downtime configs
    
- I'm preparing for CEH certification and use tools like Nmap, Fail2Ban, and system hardening guidelines to stay sharp
    

> I believe automation isn't just about speed — it's about **resilience, repeatability, and reducing attack surface.**
